## TODOs

1. Docker setup so that a single command starts the node? Hopefully can reduce to just cloning the repo and running a docker command or two
2. How to log data once the container is launched?
3. Lets say someone shows up with another container for another sensor, how to connect them so we can record everything with one command?
4. Implement common list scheduler. Have to change the way the sequence is specified....
5. Test the full setup here.
